## REAL ESTATE DATA WEB SCRAPING
Hi all, my first _webscraping_ project, aims at collecting the necessary info from websites like 99acres.com.<br/>
**Tools used**: **Selenium** package, **BeautifulSoup**, and **WebDriver** module, **pandas** to store data, and b as the primary language. 

  1. Just run the code in any environment having required packages, and the CSV files gets created.
  2. Has two files: residentialplots.csv and rentedplots.csv - for Buy and Rent plots.
