## **REAL ESTATE DATA WEB SCRAPING**
Hi all, my first _webscraping_ project, aims at collecting the real estate info from 99acres.com.<br/>
**Tools used**: **Selenium** package, **BeautifulSoup**, and **WebDriver** module, **pandas** to store data, and **Python** as the primary language. 

### STEPS TO RUN THE FILES:
  1. Install Python from https://www.python.org/downloads
  2. Install Python packages:  _pip install_ -  Pandas, BeautifulSoup, Selenium, and WebDriver
  3. You are ready to run the scripts and praise web scraping.
  4. Happy Web Scraping<br/>
